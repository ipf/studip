There are two necessary confic files. They are stored at the following locations

local.inc -> this file is located in the phplib directory 
config.inc.php ->this file is located in the studip web-root

You will find basic versions of these files in these folders.
They should work with the default dumps.

There are some further config files, that may help you:

.htaccess.dist -> use this file if you want to set apache/php values via .htacces file
studip-httpd.conf.dist -> use this file if you want to set apache/php values via httpd.conf
